        <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the JavaScript Introduction course! In this article we will look at JavaScript from a high level, answering questions such as "What is it?" and "What can you do with it?", and making sure you are comfortable with JavaScript's purpose.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Definition -->
      <section class="main-section" id="definition">
        <h2>A high-level definition</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.</li>
          <li>CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example setting background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The three layers build on top of one another nicely. Let's take a simple text label as an example. We can mark it up using HTML to give it structure and purpose:</p>
        <code class="code-example"><p>Player 1: Chris</p></code>
        <p>Then we can add some CSS into the mix to get it looking nice:</p>
        <code class="code-example">p {<br>
          font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, sans-serif;<br>
          letter-spacing: 1px;<br>
          text-transform: uppercase;<br>
          text-align: center;<br>
          border: 2px solid rgba(0,0,200,0.6);<br>
          background: rgba(0,0,200,0.3);<br>
          color: rgba(0,0,200,0.6);<br>
          box-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,200,0.4);<br>
          border-radius: 10px;<br>
          padding: 3px 10px;<br>
          display: inline-block;<br>
          cursor: pointer;<br>
          }
        </code>
        <p>And finally, we can add some JavaScript to implement dynamic behavior:</p>
        <code class="code-example">
          const para = document.querySelector('p');

          para.addEventListener('click', updateName);
          
          function updateName() {
            const name = prompt('Enter a new name');
            para.textContent = `Player 1: ${name}`;
          }
          </code>
          <p>JavaScript can do a lot more than that — let's explore what in more detail.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Capabilities -->
      <section class="main-section" id="capabilities">
        <h2>What can it really do?</h2>
        <p>The core client-side JavaScript language consists of some common programming features that allow you to do things like:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Store useful values inside variables. In the above example for instance, we ask for a new name to be entered then store that name in a variable called name.</li>
          <li>Operations on pieces of text (known as "strings" in programming). In the above example we take the string "Player 1: " and join it to the name variable to create the complete text label, e.g. ''Player 1: Chris".</li>
          <li>Running code in response to certain events occurring on a web page. We used a click event in our example above to detect when the button is clicked and then run the code that updates the text label.</li>
          <li>And much more!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>What is even more exciting however is the functionality built on top of the client-side JavaScript language. So-called Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) provide you with extra superpowers to use in your JavaScript code.

          APIs are ready-made sets of code building blocks that allow a developer to implement programs that would otherwise be hard or impossible to implement. They do the same thing for programming that ready-made furniture kits do for home building — it is much easier to take ready-cut panels and screw them together to make a bookshelf than it is to work out the design yourself, go and find the correct wood, cut all the panels to the right size and shape, find the correct-sized screws, and then put them together to make a bookshelf.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Function -->
      <section class="main-section" id="function">
        <h2>What is JavaScript doing on your page?</h2>
        <p>Here we'll explore what actually happens when you run some JavaScript in your page.

          Let's briefly recap the story of what happens when you load a web page in a browser (first talked about in our How CSS works article). When you load a web page in your browser, you are running your code (the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) inside an execution environment (the browser tab). This is like a factory that takes in raw materials (the code) and outputs a product (the web page).
        
          A very common use of JavaScript is to dynamically modify HTML and CSS to update a user interface, via the Document Object Model API (as mentioned above). Note that the code in your web documents is generally loaded and executed in the order it appears on the page. Errors may occur if JavaScript is loaded and run before the HTML and CSS that it is intended to modify. You will learn ways around this later in the article, in the Script loading strategies section.
        </p>
        <h3>Browser security</h3>
        <p>Each browser tab has its own separate bucket for running code in (these buckets are called "execution environments" in technical terms) — this means that in most cases the code in each tab is run completely separately, and the code in one tab cannot directly affect the code in another tab — or on another website. This is a good security measure — if this were not the case, then pirates could start writing code to steal information from other websites, and other such bad things.</p>
        <h3>JavaScript running order</h3>
        <p>When the browser encounters a block of JavaScript, it generally runs it in order, from top to bottom. This means that you need to be careful what order you put things in. For example, let's return to the block of JavaScript we saw in our first example:</p>
        <code class="code-example">
          const para = document.querySelector('p');<br>
          <br>
          para.addEventListener('click', updateName);<br>
          <br>
          function updateName() {<br>
            const name = prompt('Enter a new name');<br>
            para.textContent = `Player 1: ${name}`;<br>
          }
        </code>
        <p>Here we are selecting a text paragraph (line 1), then attaching an event listener to it (line 3) so that when the paragraph is clicked, the updateName() code block (lines 5–8) is run. The updateName() code block (these types of reusable code blocks are called "functions") asks the user for a new name, and then inserts that name into the paragraph to update the display.

          If you swapped the order of the first two lines of code, it would no longer work — instead, you'd get an error returned in the browser developer console — TypeError: para is undefined. This means that the para object does not exist yet, so we can't add an event listener to it.</p>
        <h3>Interpreted versus compiled code</h3>
        <p>You might hear the terms interpreted and compiled in the context of programming. In interpreted languages, the code is run from top to bottom and the result of running the code is immediately returned. You don't have to transform the code into a different form before the browser runs it. The code is received in its programmer-friendly text form and processed directly from that.

          Compiled languages on the other hand are transformed (compiled) into another form before they are run by the computer. For example, C/C++ are compiled into machine code that is then run by the computer. The program is executed from a binary format, which was generated from the original program source code.
          
          JavaScript is a lightweight interpreted programming language. The web browser receives the JavaScript code in its original text form and runs the script from that. From a technical standpoint, most modern JavaScript interpreters actually use a technique called just-in-time compiling to improve performance; the JavaScript source code gets compiled into a faster, binary format while the script is being used, so that it can be run as quickly as possible. However, JavaScript is still considered an interpreted language, since the compilation is handled at run time, rather than ahead of time.
          
          There are advantages to both types of language, but we won't discuss them right now.</p>
        <h3>Dynamic versus static code</h3>
        <p>The word dynamic is used to describe both client-side JavaScript, and server-side languages — it refers to the ability to update the display of a web page/app to show different things in different circumstances, generating new content as required. Server-side code dynamically generates new content on the server, e.g. pulling data from a database, whereas client-side JavaScript dynamically generates new content inside the browser on the client, e.g. creating a new HTML table, filling it with data requested from the server, then displaying the table in a web page shown to the user. The meaning is slightly different in the two contexts, but related, and both approaches (server-side and client-side) usually work together.

          A web page with no dynamically updating content is referred to as static — it just shows the same content all the time.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Application -->
      <section class="main-section" id="application">
        <h2>How do you add JavaScript to your page?</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is applied to your HTML page in a similar manner to CSS. Whereas CSS uses link elements to apply external stylesheets and style elements to apply internal stylesheets to HTML, JavaScript only needs one friend in the world of HTML — the script element. Let's learn how this works.</p>
        <h3>Internal JavaScript</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>First of all, make a local copy of our example file apply-javascript.html. Save it in a directory somewhere sensible</li>
          <li>Open the file in your web browser and in your text editor. You'll see that the HTML creates a simple web page containing a clickable button.</li>
          <li>Next, go to your text editor and add the following in your head — just before your closing <code>head</code> tag:</li>
          <code class="code-example">
             script <br>
             <br>
            // JavaScript goes here<br>
          
             /script 
          </code>
          <li>Now we'll add some JavaScript inside our <code>script</code> element to make the page do something more interesting — add the following code just below the "// JavaScript goes here" line:</li>
          <code class="code-example">
            document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {<br>
            function createParagraph() {<br>
              const para = document.createElement('p');<br>
              para.textContent = 'You clicked the button!';<br>
              document.body.appendChild(para);<br>
            }<br>
            <br>
            const buttons = document.querySelectorAll('button');<br>
            <br>
            for (const button of buttons) {<br>
              button.addEventListener('click', createParagraph);<br>
            }<br>
            });
          </code>
          <li>Save your file and refresh the browser — now you should see that when you click the button, a new paragraph is generated and placed below.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>External JavaScript</h3>
        <p>This works great, but what if we wanted to put our JavaScript in an external file? Let's explore this now.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>First, create a new file in the same directory as your sample HTML file. Call it <code>script.js</code> — make sure it has that .js filename extension, as that's how it is recognized as JavaScript.</li>
          <li>Replace your current <code>script</code> element with the following:</li>
          <code class="code-example">
            script src="script.js" defer> /script
          </code>
          <li>Inside <code>script.js</code>, add the following script:</li>
          <code class="code-example">
            function createParagraph() {<br>
              const para = document.createElement('p');<br>
              para.textContent = 'You clicked the button!';<br>
              document.body.appendChild(para);<br>
            }<br>
            <br>
            const buttons = document.querySelectorAll('button');<br>
            <br>
            for (const button of buttons) {<br>
              button.addEventListener('click', createParagraph);<br>
            }            
          </code>
          <li>Save and refresh your browser, and you should see the same thing! It works just the same, but now we've got our JavaScript in an external file. This is generally a good thing in terms of organizing your code and making it reusable across multiple HTML files. Plus, the HTML is easier to read without huge chunks of script dumped in it.</li>
        </ol>
