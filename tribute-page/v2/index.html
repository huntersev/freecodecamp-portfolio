    <p> Naruto is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. As Naruto was born, his home village of Konoha came under attack by a nine-tailed fox demon which was sealed in him at infancy to protect the people of the village. Due to this fact he became distrusted and resented by the people around him during his childhood. He, however, aspires to become the Hokage; a title given to the leader of Hidden Leaf Village, and as the most poorly performing student in his ninja school, he strives to prove his worth to his peers and fellow villagers. </p>

  <p> Because he is. Naruto Uzumaki is one of the most enjoyable, inspiring, funny, endearing, heroic, kindhearted, optimistic, morally upstanding, and likeable characters, not just in Naruto, but in fiction overall. There’s a lot to learn about Naruto and a lot of things to love about him. His character growth and development is excellent, some of the best ever, and even if you don’t like him, the complexity and nuance of his character makes him an interesting and well-written character.</p>
  <p>
  Naruto’s character has a phenomenal and incredibly well-written journey. He goes from a self-absorbed, bratty nobody who no one cares about to an extremely selfless, mature adult who is loved and respected by just about everyone and who is at the forefront of leading his world into a time of peace. Naruto was a love-starved child who found his own family and became the kind of person who wanted to protect them no matter what.
  </p><p>
  Naruto’s character provides a lot of thought-provoking thematic elements, as his character gives nice exploration and insight into the nature of loneliness, love, forgiveness, and empathy. Naruto has taught me the importance of empathy and trying to understand another more than any character in fiction.
